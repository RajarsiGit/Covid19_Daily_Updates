# Covid19_Daily_Updates
This mainly focuses on maintaining Covid-19 data on MongoDB database
This is used to keep a maintained database of all the Covid19 cases around the world and also specially in the United States. I have used mongo cloud to store all the data in the database and view and retieve information as and when required.
The data is taken in cvs format and cleaned before it is imported into the cloud database

## Features:
* Canvas is an absolutely new tag and has been added to HTML5. It was first launched by Apple for their Mac OS X Webkit.
* Allows dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. Through WebGL it allows 3D shapes and images to be displayed
* The <canvas> element defines a region in the document, which can be used to draw graphics on the fly via JavaScript. For example, it can be used to draw paths and shapes, graphs, or even perform animations.
* Supports several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

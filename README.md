# Covid19_Daily_Updates
This mainly focuses on maintaining Covid-19 data on MongoDB database
This is used to keep a maintained database of all the Covid19 cases around the world and also specially in the United States. I have used mongo cloud to store all the data in the database and view and retieve information as and when required.
The data is taken in cvs format and cleaned before it is imported into the cloud database
